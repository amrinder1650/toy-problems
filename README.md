# Overview
This repo is for the leetcode and daily challenge problems!

These problems are from leetcode and HRX daily challenge!
For each problem that I attempt, I will attach the OICE exercise I did. I will also provide an example or reason to better understand the logic/my thought process.

For each problem I attempt, there is a test suite in tp.spec.js.

# Example

Problem: Create a function that adds two positive integers together.

OICE:
O: a positive integer
I: two positive integers
C: constant time
E: n/a

Pseudocode:
// var result set to 0
// result = input1 + input2
//reutrn result

(Yes, I know I can return input1 + input2. This is just for demonstrative purposes.)

Code:
var result = 0;
result = input1 + input2
return result
